"""
Every chemistry and relaxation knob.

Defaults settings tuned for the stoichiometric rutile TiO2 (110) surface (pymatgen's
termination index 1). ``scripts/core/validate_materials.py`` re-checks this for any new material.

Every value below has a matching command-line flag. Edit this file to change the
default for everything; pass the flag to change one run. The flag always wins.
