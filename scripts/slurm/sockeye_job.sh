# One SLURM job = one full pipeline run on one node.
#
# relax() is a blocking, serial subprocess.run, so this asks for a single task and lets
# torch use the cores via threads. Nothing here parallelises across nodes; that is a
# later change to relax(), not to this script.
#
# Submit from a directory in /scratch, NOT from the repo in /arc/project — Sockeye
# rejects the job outright ("Submitting jobs from directories residing in /arc/project is
# not allowed"). Project space is backed up and snapshotted for durability; scratch is the
# parallel filesystem meant to absorb job I/O. Only the *working directory* is restricted,
# so the script itself stays in the repo and is named by absolute path:
#
#     cd /scratch/st-akkiraju-1/$USER
#     sbatch /arc/project/st-akkiraju-1/$USER/oxideflow/scripts/slurm/sockeye_job.sh
#     sbatch /arc/.../sockeye_job.sh --material mp-825 --protocol seeded
#
# Anything after the script name is forwarded to the pipeline verbatim. The package is
# installed editable, so it imports from /arc/project no matter where the job runs.
#
# GPU runs need a *different allocation* — Sockeye rejects --gres=gpu unless the account
# ends in -gpu — and command-line flags beat the #SBATCH lines below, so no edit is needed:
#
#     sbatch --account=st-akkiraju-1-gpu --partition=gpu --gres=gpu:1 --time=0:30:00 \
#            /arc/.../sockeye_job.sh --candidates UMA-oc22 ...
#
# BOTH worker envs need a CUDA torch for any GPU run — not just the one holding the
# candidate. RunConfig.reference is MACE-mh1-omat, so every run loads MACE first to build
# the ground truth, whatever --candidates says. A CPU-only mace-clean therefore fails even
# on a pure-UMA run, with "Attempting to deserialize object on a CUDA device but
# torch.cuda.is_available() is False".
#
# Install torch from cu126 in both: the GPUs are V100 (sm_70) and newer CUDA indexes have
# dropped Volta, while older ones (cu124) top out below the torch~=2.8.0 that
# fairchem-core 2.21.0 requires. cu126 is the overlap.
#
# /arc/project is mounted READ-ONLY on compute nodes, so the archive step below cannot
# succeed from inside a job — it warns and continues by design. Copy from the login node:
#     rsync -a /scratch/st-akkiraju-1/$USER/runs/ /arc/project/st-akkiraju-1/$USER/runs/
#
# Consequence: --outdir is relative to $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR, so results land in scratch,
# which is purged on a timer. See the end of this script.
