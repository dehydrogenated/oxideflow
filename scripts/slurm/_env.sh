# Sourced with an absolute path on purpose: SLURM copies the batch script into a spool
# directory before running it, so ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} points at /var/spool/... and cannot be
# used to find the repo. $PROJECT is fixed on Sockeye, so hardcoding it is the honest option.
#
# Source this AFTER `set -euo pipefail` so a missing/broken env file aborts the job instead
# of running it half-configured.
#
# Compute nodes are far more restricted than the login node, and every export below exists
# because one of those restrictions bit an actual run:
#   - no outbound network      -> anything that reaches out must fail fast, not hang to walltime
#   - $HOME and /arc/project are READ-ONLY -> every library cache must be redirected to scratch
#   - GPUs are granted by the scheduler, not by a flag in a file
#
# Overrides a job may set BEFORE sourcing:
#   OXW_DEVICE=cpu    pin the device (see the detection block below)
#   OXW_ENV=<name>    activate a conda env other than `oxw`
#   OXW_CACHE=<dir>   cache root, default $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/.cache
