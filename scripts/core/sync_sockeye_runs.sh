# Pulls run output from Sockeye's durable $PROJECT/runs down to this laptop's runs/,
# so a completed job becomes locally readable/analyzable without a manual rsync
# invocation each time. This is the second hop -- every .slurm job script already
# prints the first hop (scratch -> $PROJECT/runs) to run on the Sockeye login node;
# this script runs from the local machine and does scratch's *destination* -> here.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/core/sync_sockeye_runs.sh                    # pull the whole remote runs/ tree
#   scripts/core/sync_sockeye_runs.sh mo2_ads_benchmark   # pull just one run subdirectory
